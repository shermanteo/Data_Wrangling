# Background of problem: In this set of practice exercises we’ll be looking at a cool dataset of real passwords (made available from actual data breaches) sourced and compiled from Information is Beautiful and contributed to R’s Tidy Tuesday project. These passwords are common (“bad”) passwords that you should avoid using! But we’re going to use this dataset to practice some regex skills.
